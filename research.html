<h2>Seminars</h2>
I am not running any seminars currently. 
These are seminars that I have run before:
<li> Quantum PCPs seminar, Spring 2024 at Waterloo.</li>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
Here are some things I have done beyond just TAing:
<li> I supervised a measure theory reading group I ran. Here are the <a href="assets/presentations/Folland_PSETs.pdf">Problem sets and weekly readings</a></li>
<li>Counselor at Ross 2023 Indiana. It is a math camp for gifted high schoolers, and this was one of the best experiences I had. <a href="rossprogram.org">more info</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-mathematics/directed-reading-research-programs-drp">Directed reading program at Waterloo for Women in Math</a>. 
  <li> 2023 Winter, Model theory.</li>
  <li> 2024 Fall, Word hyperbolic groups</li>
</li>
<h2>Talks </h2>
Here are my talk slides/recorded talks:

<li><a href="assets/presentations/Model_theory_vN.pdf">Model theory of II_1 factors</a>, for an introductory course on tracial von Nuemann algebras. </li>
