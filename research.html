<li> I supervised a measure theory reading group I ran. Here are the <a href="assets/presentations/Folland_PSETs.pdf">Problem sets and weekly readings</a></li>
<li>Counselor at Ross 2023 Indiana. It is a math camp for gifted high schoolers, and this was one of the best experiences I had. <a href="rossprogram.org">more info</a></li>
