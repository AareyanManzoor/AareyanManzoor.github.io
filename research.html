    <strong>Invariant Random Subgroups, Soficity, and Lück’s determinant conjecture</strong>, August 2025,

      <summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>
      We extend Lück’s determinant conjecture from groups to invariant random subgroups (IRS) of free groups, a framework generalizing groups where a non-sofic object is known to exist. For every free group, we prove the existence of an IRS satisfying the determinant conjecture that is not co-hyperlinear, and hence not co-sofic. This provides evidence that satisfying the determinant conjecture might be a weaker property than soficity for groups, and consequently the conjecture possibly holds for all groups. We use techniques from non-local games and <strong>MIP*</strong> = <strong>RE</strong>, showing more generally when the latter can be used to narrow down when a von Neumann algebra (or IRS) contains a non-Connes embeddable object.

    <strong>There Is An Equivalence Relation Whose von Neumann Algebra Is Not Connes Embeddable</strong>, February 2025,

      <summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>
      MIP* = RE was used to prove the existence of a non-Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebra. Recently, similar ideas were used in [Bow + 24, BCV 24] to give a negative solution to the Aldous–Lyons conjecture: there is a non co-sofic IRS on any non-abelian free group. We define a notion of hyperlinearity for an IRS and show that there is a non co-hyperlinear IRS on any non-abelian free group, which reproves the main results of [Bow + 24, BCV 24]. As a corollary, we prove that there is a relation whose von Neumann algebra is not Connes embeddable.

  <summary><em>Abstract / Description</em></summary>
  I survey the <a href="assets/presentations/masters.pdf">Quantum PCP</a> conjecture, 
  discussing the NLTS theorem, quantum error-correcting codes, complexity-theoretic preliminaries, and more. 
  At Waterloo, the master’s thesis is really meant to be expository and generally doesn’t contain new results — 
  but I do show that a bound for CSS local testability in the literature is off by a constant.

<h2>Seminars</h2>
I am not running any seminars currently. 
These are seminars that I have run before:
<li> Quantum PCPs seminar, Spring 2024 at Waterloo.</li>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
Here are some things I have done beyond just TAing:
<ul>

<li> I supervised a measure theory reading group I ran. Here are the <a href="assets/presentations/Folland_PSETs.pdf">Problem sets and weekly readings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rossprogram.org">Ross Math camp</a> counselor 2023 and 2025.</li>
<ul>
	We did 10 hour overnight lectures where I was one of the main lecturers both years. 2023 was Galois theory with 3 of us lecturing for the 10 hours. 2025 was <a href="assets/presentations/Algebraic_Topology.pdf">Algebraic topology</a> with 2 of us.
</ul>
<li> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-mathematics/directed-reading-research-programs-drp">Directed reading program at Waterloo for Women in Math</a>. 
  <ul>
  <li> 2023 Winter, Model theory.</li>
  <li> 2024 Fall, Word hyperbolic groups</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
