I will post papers, talks etc here.

<h2>Papers</h2>
<li>Manzoor, There Is An Equivalence Relation Whose von Neumann Algebra Is Not Connes Embeddable, 2025, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06697">	arXiv:2502.06697</a></li>
<p> I also have a <a href="assets/presentations/masters.pdf">masters thesis</a>. At Waterloo the masters thesis is really supposed to be expository and not have new results, and for the most part this is true. I do show that a bound for CSS local testability in literature is off by a constant.</p>


<h2>Seminar/Conference Talks </h2>
<p>Here are talks I have given at seminars/conferences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="assets/presentations/IRS.pdf">There is a non-Connes embeddable Equivalence Relation</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.cosy2025.ca/schedule">COSY 2025, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada</a></li>
      <li>UIUC Quantum Lunch, 11th July 2025</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Seminars</h2>
I am not running any seminars currently. 
These are seminars that I have run before:
<li> Quantum PCPs seminar, Spring 2024 at Waterloo.</li>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
Here are some things I have done beyond just TAing:
<ul>

<li> I supervised a measure theory reading group I ran. Here are the <a href="assets/presentations/Folland_PSETs.pdf">Problem sets and weekly readings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rossprogram.org">Ross Math camp</a> counselor 2023 and 2025.</li>
<ul>
	We did 10 hour overnight lectures where I was one of the main lecturers both years. 2023 was Galois theory with 3 of us lecturing for the 10 hours. 2025 was <a href="assets/presentations/Algebraic_Topology.pdf">Algebraic topology</a> with 2 of us.
</ul>
<li> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-mathematics/directed-reading-research-programs-drp">Directed reading program at Waterloo for Women in Math</a>. 
  <ul>
  <li> 2023 Winter, Model theory.</li>
  <li> 2024 Fall, Word hyperbolic groups</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2> Other Talks </h2>

Here are my talk slides/recorded talks:

<li><a href="assets/presentations/Model_theory_vN.pdf">Model theory of II_1 factors</a>, for an introductory course on tracial von Nuemann algebras. </li>
<li><a href="assets/presentations/QMA.pdf">The complexity class QMA</a>, for an introductory course in quantum information. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZsZBJZoLXA">On the (co)homology of spectra</a> for an seminar on stable homotopy theory </li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6raE7z8qwA">Brown representability</a> same seminar</li>
