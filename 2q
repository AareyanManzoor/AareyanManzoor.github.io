Hello, I am Aareyan Manzoor, a 3rd year UG at ASU. I am a math student and plan to go into math research. My interests in math are very varied, I love the interplay between seemingly different fields a lot. 

This is my website. I shall have a section on my blog, which I will update periodically with cool math stuff I learn. I will have a section for scans, I believe in freedom of information even when certain institutions don't. I will put up scans of work that are not avalaible anywhere on the net there, that I get my hand on ofcourse. I am also running a TeX group, for which I shall also create a page.

If you want to hangout/talk to me, feel free to add my discord johnDS#1149 or join the <a href="https://discord.gg/math">Math discord server</a>
