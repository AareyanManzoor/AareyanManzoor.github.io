<p> This is a group that TeX's up old book and modernizes notation in them. The purpose is 2-fold, to make some of these older books easier to access and also easier to read. We include a lot of modern formatting, such as hyperlinks between different sections of the book, hyperlinks to citations, more modern fonts, all diagrams redrawn to be more modern, tikz etc. To make the book easier to read for everyone, we also produce a ``dyslexic friendly version'' of each book, using the font ``open dyslexic'' and changing some macros. </p>

<p> Please let your peers know about these newly TeX'd books! To join, either email me at amanzoo1 at asu dot edu, or hit up my discord JohnDS#1149. The group is primarily ran on discord, and the projects on overleaf.</p>

Here are our projects:
<li><a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Adams-SHGH-latex.pdf"> Adams blue book</a>.This is a classic intro to stable homotopy theory, and our first project as a result. This was done July 2022. <a href="/assets/blue-book-dyslexic.pdf">Dyslexic friendly version </a>. Our <a href="https://github.com/AareyanManzoor/Adams-Blue-Book">TeX</a> is also on github. </li>
<li><a href="/assets/hicks.pdf">Hicks notes on differential geometry</a>, a very good intro to the topic with a good selection of topics. This was done August 2022.<a href="/assets/hicks-dyslexic.pdf">dyslexic friendly version</a>. Our <a href="https://github.com/AareyanManzoor/Hicks-Notes-Diff-Geo">TeX</a> is on github.</li>
<li><a href="/assets/matsumura-CA.pdf">Matsumura's Commutative Algebra</a> another famous book, this time for commutative algebra. This was done August 2022. <a href="/assets/matsumura-CA-dyslexic.pdf">dyslexic friendly version</a>. Our <a href="https://github.com/AareyanManzoor/Matsumura-Commutative-Algebra">TeX</a> is on github.</li>

<li>We are currently doing Milnor and Stasheff's ``characteristic classes''</li>
