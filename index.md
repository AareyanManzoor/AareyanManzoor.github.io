Hello I am Aareyan Manzoor. I did my UG at ASU, and now am doing grad school at U Waterloo. I love the interplay of different fields in math and as such I have decided to go into operator algebras, a field that intersects pretty much every other fields. I think it is beautiful that functional analysis is the right setting to get non-commutative analogues of topics like geometry and topology. Every aspect of the field seems exciting to me, but once I am further into grad school Ill have picked a favourite part.

This is my website. I shall have a section on my blog, which I will update periodically with cool math stuff I learn. I will have a section for scans, I believe in freedom of information even when certain institutions don't. I will put up scans of work that are not avalaible anywhere on the net there, that I get my hand on ofcourse. I also used to run a TeX group, but it is inactive right now. I will keep the page up since we did produce good work.

If you want to hangout/talk to me, feel free to add my discord johnds.
