Hello I am Aareyan Manzoor, a math student at ASU. I love the interplay of different fields in math and as such I have decided to go into C\*-algebras, a field that intersects pretty much every other fields. I think it is beautiful that functional analysis is the right setting to get non-commutative analogues of topics like geometry and topology, and I want to study non-commutative geometry in particular.

This is my website. I shall have a section on my blog, which I will update periodically with cool math stuff I learn. I will have a section for scans, I believe in freedom of information even when certain institutions don't. I will put up scans of work that are not avalaible anywhere on the net there, that I get my hand on ofcourse. I am also running a TeX group, for which I shall also create a page.

If you want to hangout/talk to me, feel free to add my discord johnDS#1149 or join the <a href="https://discord.gg/math">Math discord server</a>
