Hello I am Aareyan Manzoor. I did my undergrad at Arizona State University and my Masters at University of Waterloo. I am currently doing my PhD also at Waterloo under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~m2branna/">Micheal Brannan</a> and <a href="https://math.vanderbilt.edu/peters10">Jesse Peterson</a>. I work on Operator algebras and its intersections with quantum information mainly. I am particularly interested in ideas surrounding the Connes embedding problem, my lifes goal right now being to find a non-hyperlinear group. The best partial result in this area is due to me.

This is my website. I will have a research section to list my research/teaching things. I shall have a section on my blog, which I will update periodically with cool math stuff I learn. I also used to run a TeX group, but it is inactive right now. I will keep the page up since we did produce good work.

If you want to hangout/talk to me, feel free to add my discord johnds. If you are a Bangladeshi in math hit me up!
