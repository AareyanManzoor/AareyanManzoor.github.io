<p> I am running A latex group, we are in charge ot TeXing up old books. The goal is to make some great old books more accessible. Currently the following have been TeX'd up. Add me on discord at johnDS@1149 or email me at amanzoo1@asu.edu to join the groups. Also feel free to email me typos, comments or index suggestions for any of the books.</p>

<li><a href="/assets/hicks.pdf">Hicks notes on differential geometry</a>, a very good intro to the topic with a good selection of topics. We are currently in the progress of doing this.</li></p>
